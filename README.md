# Stock Market Analysis for 2017 and 2018

## Project Overview

#### The purpose of this project was to create a workbook with VBA so that Steve could quickly analyze data from 12 stocks for the years 2017 and 2018 so that he could advise his parents on potential investments.

## Results

### Stock Analysis

#### In 2017 all stocks performed well with positive rate of return with the exception of TERP.  9 of the 12 stocks performed exceptionally well with a return greater than 20%.  2018 was much different with 10 of the 12 stocks posting a negative return.  The two stocks that posted a positive return in 2018 were ENPH and RUN.  ENPH performed consistently in 2017 and 2018.

### Code Performance

#### There was a slight difference between the original code and the refactored code in terms of time; however, there was a 9 - 12 perecent reduction in time.  When executing the code on larger datasets a 9 - 12 percent reduction could make a big difference in the total execution time.
